# Strategic Engine Configuration — SE-2
# Controls scoring thresholds, severity classification, and ranking weights.
# Changes to this file are tracked via config_version in API responses.

# Scoring model:
#   score = (1 - (rank - 1) / (total - 1)) * 100
#   status = critical if score >= critical_threshold
#            attention if score >= attention_threshold
#            else stable
